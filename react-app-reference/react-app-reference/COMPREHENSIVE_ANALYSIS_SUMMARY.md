**üöÄ TaxRush Performance & Adoption**
- TaxRush revenue impact analysis needed
- Regional adoption patterns (urban vs rural) 
- Performance benchmarks (TaxRush vs non-TaxRush offices)
- Royalty rate validation (currently 40% - accurate?)

**üí∞ KPI Thresholds & Business Performance**
- Validate default KPI thresholds from spec:
  - Cost per Return: Green ‚â§ $25, Yellow ‚â§ $35
  - Net Margin: Green ‚â• 20%, Yellow ‚â• 10%
- Seasonal KPI variation patterns
- Achievement rates ("what % get all green?")

**üèóÔ∏è Expense Category Benchmarks**  
- Validate preset progressions (Good=26% salaries, Better=24%, Best=22%)
- Identify highest-impact expense optimizations
- Common "expense creep" patterns franchises experience

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common User Errors & Validation Issues**
- Most common unrealistic input combinations
- Business logic violations indicating confusion
- "Garbage in, garbage out" scenarios to prevent

**üéØ Scenario Preset Validation**
- Are Good/Better/Best based on real franchise data?
- What percentile achieve each level?
- Missing scenarios: "Struggling" or "Recovery" presets?

*Plus 4 more categories covering forecasting accuracy, regional differences, edge cases, and AI-driven pattern recognition.*

### **2. Pro-Tips Testing & Validation Framework**
**File:** `PRO_TIPS_TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` (new)

#### **Comprehensive Quality Assurance System:**

**üß™ Content Validation Tests**
- Data source verification (must cite specific sources)
- Statistical accuracy checks (realistic percentages/ranges)
- Regional accuracy validation (Canada vs US differences)

**üéØ Actionability Testing**
- Specific guidance requirements (concrete steps, not generic advice)
- Implementability checks (realistic for franchise owners)
- Success criteria and timeline validation

**üìä Quality Scoring System (0-100 points)**
- Content Quality (40 pts): Data source + accuracy + completeness
- Actionability (30 pts): Specificity + feasibility
- Relevance (30 pts): Targeting + timing

**üé≤ Scenario Testing Framework**
- Automated trigger testing for different business scenarios
- Edge case validation (new stores, red KPIs, regional differences)
- A/B testing methodology for tip effectiveness

## üíé **High-Value Insights Discovered**

### **üî• Critical Pro-Tips Opportunities**

#### **1. Validation Gap Insights**
The QA analysis revealed **users can enter completely unrealistic data** without warnings:
- Salaries >40% (business killer - when and why?)
- Rent >25% (market conditions vs poor planning?)
- Discounts >5% (what drives excessive discounting?)

**Pro-Tip Opportunity:** Real-time "sanity check" guidance when users enter risky combinations.

#### **2. Business Logic Confusion**
Found complex interdependencies users don't understand:
- Average Net Fee sensitivity ($1 increase = $X total revenue impact)
- Expense category calculation bases (% of gross vs % of tax prep income)
- Seasonal adjustment patterns (peak vs off-season performance)

**Pro-Tip Opportunity:** Contextual education during input with impact previews.

#### **3. Regional Complexity**
Canada vs US differences create confusion:
- TaxRush adoption patterns and revenue impact
- Different royalty structures and business models
- Currency and regulatory factors

**Pro-Tip Opportunity:** Region-specific guidance and benchmarking.

#### **4. Preset Scenario Validation**
Good/Better/Best presets need validation:
- Are these based on real franchise performance quartiles?
- Do improvement patterns match reality?
- Missing "Recovery" scenarios for struggling franchises?

**Pro-Tip Opportunity:** Evidence-based improvement pathways.

### **üéØ Specific Research Questions to Prioritize**

#### **Immediate High-Impact Questions:**
1. **"What % of franchises achieve 'all green' KPIs?"**
   - Helps set realistic expectations vs aspirational targets
   
2. **"What expense optimizations have highest ROI?"**
   - Guides users toward most impactful improvements first
   
3. **"How accurate are first-year revenue projections typically?"**
   - Helps new franchisees set realistic expectations
   
4. **"What are red flag expense combinations?"**
   - Early warning system for financial trouble

#### **Strategic Research Questions:**
1. **"TaxRush performance patterns by region/store type"**
   - Drives Canada-specific strategic advice
   
2. **"Seasonal adjustment best practices"**
   - Helps with quarterly/monthly forecasting accuracy
   
3. **"Common improvement pathways from struggling to successful"**
   - Creates "recovery roadmap" guidance
