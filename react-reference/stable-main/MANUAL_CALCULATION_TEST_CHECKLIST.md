## üìä **QUICK REFERENCE CALCULATIONS**

### **Standard Test Case (ANF: $125, Returns: 1,600, Discounts: 3%)**
```
Gross Fees = $125 √ó 1,600 = $200,000
Discounts = $200,000 √ó 3% = $6,000
Tax Prep Income = $200,000 - $6,000 = $194,000

Salaries (25%) = $200,000 √ó 25% = $50,000
Royalties (14%) = $194,000 √ó 14% = $27,160
```

### **CA with TaxRush (ANF: $130, Returns: 1,400, TaxRush: 300, Discounts: 4%)**
```
Gross Fees = $130 √ó 1,400 = $182,000
Discounts = $182,000 √ó 4% = $7,280
Tax Prep Income = $182,000 - $7,280 = $174,720
Total Returns = 1,400 + 300 = 1,700

TaxRush Royalties (6%) = $174,720 √ó 6% = $10,483
```
