# Pro-Tips Testing & Validation Framework
*Framework for validating Pro-Tips content quality and accuracy*

## üéØ **Testing Philosophy**

Pro-Tips must be **data-driven, actionable, and contextually relevant**. This framework ensures every tip meets these standards before implementation.

---

## üß™ **Content Validation Tests**

### **Test Suite 1: Data Integrity**

#### **Test 1.1: Source Verification**
```yaml
Test: Does the tip cite a legitimate data source?
Pass Criteria:
  - Specific data source identified (not vague)
  - Sample size mentioned where applicable  
  - Date range or recency indicated
  - Authority/credibility of source established

Examples:
  ‚úÖ "Based on analysis of 847 Liberty Tax franchises (2022-2024 tax seasons)"
  ‚ùå "Most franchises find that..." (no source)
  ‚ùå "Industry data shows..." (too vague)
```

#### **Test 1.2: Statistical Accuracy**
```yaml
Test: Are percentages, ranges, and claims mathematically sound?
Pass Criteria:
  - Numbers add up correctly
  - Percentages based on valid denominators
  - Ranges reflect actual data distribution
  - No impossible combinations (>100% totals)

Examples:
  ‚úÖ "73% of franchises implementing TaxRush see 15-25% revenue increase"
  ‚ùå "Most franchises see 50-80% profit increases" (unrealistic)
```

#### **Test 1.3: Regional Accuracy**
```yaml
Test: Does the tip correctly reflect regional differences?
Pass Criteria:
  - Canada vs US differences acknowledged
  - TaxRush availability properly gated
  - Regional business practices considered
  - Currency/regulatory differences noted

Examples:
  ‚úÖ "Canadian franchises with TaxRush average 23% more returns per season"
  ‚ùå "TaxRush implementation increases all franchise revenue" (US doesn't have TaxRush)
```

---

### **Test Suite 2: Actionability**

#### **Test 2.1: Specific Guidance** 
```yaml
Test: Does the tip provide concrete, actionable steps?
Pass Criteria:
  - Specific actions defined (not generic advice)
  - Clear implementation steps provided
  - Measurable outcomes suggested
  - Timeline expectations set

Examples:
  ‚úÖ "Reduce supplies expense by 0.5% by switching to digital forms and bulk ordering"
  ‚ùå "Consider reducing expenses to improve profitability" (too generic)
```

#### **Test 2.2: Implementability**
```yaml
Test: Can a franchise owner realistically implement this advice?
Pass Criteria:
  - No impossible requirements (resources, skills, authority)
  - Considers franchise agreement constraints
  - Accounts for market/seasonal factors
  - Provides fallback options for edge cases

Examples:
  ‚úÖ "Negotiate rent during lease renewal (typically 3-5 year cycles)"
  ‚ùå "Reduce rent by 50% immediately" (unrealistic)
```

---

### **Test Suite 3: Contextual Relevance**

#### **Test 3.1: Trigger Accuracy**
```yaml
Test: Does the tip trigger at appropriate times/conditions?
Pass Criteria:
  - Trigger logic matches real business scenarios
  - Avoids false positives (irrelevant triggers)
  - Considers seasonal/cyclical patterns
  - Accounts for store type/age differences

Examples:
  ‚úÖ Trigger when: Rent >20% AND store age <2 years
  ‚ùå Trigger when: Any expense >10% (too broad)
```

#### **Test 3.2: Personalization**
```yaml
Test: Is the tip relevant to the user's specific situation?
Pass Criteria:
  - Considers store type (new vs existing)
  - Reflects regional context (US vs CA)
  - Accounts for performance level (struggling vs thriving)
  - Matches business model (TaxRush vs standard)

Examples:
  ‚úÖ "New stores typically achieve 18% net margin by month 18"
  ‚ùå "All stores should maintain 20% net margin" (ignores maturity)
```

## üé≤ **Scenario Testing Framework**

### **Test Scenarios for Pro-Tips Triggers**

#### **Scenario Group A: Performance Thresholds**
```yaml
Test Scenario: Red KPI Triggers
Setup:
  - Net Income: -$3,000 (red threshold)
  - Net Margin: 8% (red threshold) 
  - Cost per Return: $45 (red threshold)

Expected Pro-Tips:
  ‚úÖ Should trigger: "High cost per return" tip
  ‚úÖ Should trigger: "Negative net income" tip
  ‚ùå Should NOT trigger: "Optimize for growth" tip

Validation Questions:
  - Are triggered tips relevant to red performance?
  - Do tips provide recovery-focused advice?
  - Are tips prioritized by impact potential?
```

#### **Scenario Group B: Regional Context**
```yaml
Test Scenario: Canada + TaxRush Enabled
Setup:
  - Region: CA
  - TaxRush: Enabled
  - TaxRush Returns: 200
  - Tax Prep Returns: 1500

Expected Pro-Tips:
  ‚úÖ Should trigger: TaxRush-specific optimization tips
  ‚úÖ Should include: Canadian franchise context
  ‚ùå Should NOT trigger: US-specific tax law tips

Validation Questions:
  - Do tips reflect Canadian business environment?
  - Are TaxRush calculations accurate?
  - Is advice implementable under Canadian franchise agreements?
```

#### **Scenario Group C: Store Lifecycle**
```yaml
Test Scenario: New Store (Year 1)
Setup:
  - Store Type: New
  - Performance: Below benchmarks
  - Growth Rate: Not applicable

Expected Pro-Tips:
  ‚úÖ Should focus on: Foundation-building advice
  ‚úÖ Should include: Realistic timeline expectations  
  ‚ùå Should NOT focus on: Advanced optimization strategies

Validation Questions:
  - Are expectations appropriate for new franchises?
  - Does advice account for learning curve?
  - Are suggested benchmarks achievable for beginners?
```
