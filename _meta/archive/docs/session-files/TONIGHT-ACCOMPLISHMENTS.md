## 📊 Technical Implementation Summary

### Files Modified

```
✅ expenses.component.html - Streamlined UI, dynamic panel
✅ expenses.component.ts - Added revenueBreakdown$ observable
✅ Created CONSOLIDATED-DEPENDENCY-ANALYSIS.md
✅ Created SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-09-25.md
✅ Removed 35 individual dependency files
```

### Key Features Delivered

```typescript
// Dynamic content based on store type
readonly revenueBreakdown$ = this.answers$.pipe(
  map(answers => {
    const isExisting = answers.storeType === 'existing';
    return {
      title: isExisting ? 'Projected...' : 'Target...',
      returns: isExisting ? projected : target,
      // ... all revenue data dynamically selected
    };
  })
);
```

## 🎯 User Requirements Met

### ✅ **"Remove income drivers section except outlined element"**

- Removed: Average Net Fee input
- Removed: Tax Prep Returns input
- Removed: TaxRush Returns input
- Removed: Customer Discounts input
- **Kept**: Revenue breakdown panel (yellow outlined box)

### ✅ **"Update with information from income drivers"**

- **Existing stores**: Uses projected performance data
- **New stores**: Uses target performance data
- **Real-time**: Updates automatically with wizard changes

### ✅ **"Consolidate documentation files"**

- **Before**: 35 separate dependency graph files
- **After**: 1 consolidated analysis document
- **Benefit**: Easier to search, maintain, and understand

## 🚧 Known Issues (For Next Session)

### Dev Server Environment Issue

- **Problem**: `npm error could not determine executable to run`
- **Impact**: Cannot test UI changes in browser tonight
- **Likely Cause**: PowerShell environment/path configuration
- **Status**: Code is complete, just needs server restart

### Next Session Priorities

1. **🔧 Fix dev server startup** (environment issue)
2. **🧪 Test dynamic revenue display** (verify store type switching)
3. **🎨 UI polish** (ensure formatting looks perfect)
