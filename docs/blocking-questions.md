Blocking Questions â€” AnalysisBlock

1) Confirm feature flag policy/location:
   - Is `FEATURE_FLAGS` the desired mechanism? Should default live in `app.config.ts` or token factory is fine?
2) Placement confirmation:
   - Wizard Step 1: preferred container/component region for analysis card?
   - Dashboard: which column/panel should host the analysis?
3) Data contract details:
   - Should comparison show Good/Better/Best vs Custom deltas by returns, avgNetFee, or combined revenue only?
   - Any copy guidelines for insights types (strategic vs tactical)?
4) Tracing:
   - Any global debug logger to use, or inline console acceptable for dev-only?
