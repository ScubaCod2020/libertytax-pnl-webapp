## Development Progress Log — Context-First Hunt & Port

2025-09-24

- Tooling maintenance: Migrated repo to Husky v9 and removed deprecated shims
  - Set `git config core.hooksPath .husky`
  - Deleted `.husky/_` helper dir to eliminate `husky.sh` deprecation banner
  - Switched from `simple-git-hooks` → Husky (`prepare` script now runs `husky`)
  - Verified `.husky/pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` and `scripts/validate-progress-log.js`
- Angular verification: `angular/` workspace confirmed on Angular 20.3.x (CLI 20.3.2)
- Node verified: v24.8.0 (meets Angular 20 requirements)

- Manual Navigator: Ported and staged AnalysisBlock (UI + types) with dev gating
  - Added `analysis.types.ts`, `analysis-block.component.ts`, and demo route `/dev/analysis-demo`
  - Placed shells on Wizard Step 1 (Projected section) and Dashboard middle column
  - Implemented `AnalysisDataAssemblerService` (Custom vs Preset variance) and feature-flag toggle in Debug Panel
  - Updated docs: teaching notes, wire-up plan, trace plan, render audit, migration status, blueprint delta

2025-09-22

- Created feature branch `feat/context-first-hunt-port`.
- Authored docs: `context-digest.md`, `calc-inventory.md`, `calc-migration-status.md`, `BLUEPRINT_DELTA.md`.
- Updated `repo-blueprint.yml` to include `domain/*` and `core/tokens/*` paths.
- Added Angular scaffolding:
  - `core/tokens/region-configs.token.ts` with `DEFAULT_REGION_CONFIGS`.
  - Service stubs: `WizardStateService`, `ConfigService`, `CalculationService`.
  - Domain: `domain/types/calculation.types.ts`, `domain/calculations/{calc,kpi,wizard-helpers,adapters}.ts`.
- Restored `pages/wizard/pnl/*` stub to satisfy routing.
- Relaxed Angular style budgets minimally (anyComponentStyle: warn 3kb, error 6kb).
- Verified Angular build succeeds.
- Ran wizard tests (n-3) in React reference; saved logs to `.logs/wizard-tests-pass{1..3}.log`.
  - Noted WizardFlowMatrix failures (expected pre-wiring); added QA analysis triage.
- Added domain unit tests and Vitest config; ran n-3 domain test passes, all green. Logs: `.logs/domain-tests-pass{1..3}.log`.

Merge/Next Steps:

- NOTE: Merge `feat/context-first-hunt-port` into `dev_09202025` before proceeding next session.
- Next session TODOs: add more domain edge-case tests; begin Angular UI wiring to `CalculationService` on wizard pages.
