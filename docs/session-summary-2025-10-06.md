- **Lines Changed**: 385 insertions, 87 deletions
- **Commit Hash**: d878ab6
- **Branch**: feature/rebuild-angular

### üêõ **Outstanding Issue**

**Triple Emission on App Load**: Income Drivers component still logs 3 times during initial load. Investigation suggests remaining subscription leak or Angular lifecycle interaction. Functionality not impacted, only logging verbosity.

### üöÄ **Current Application Status**

**30% FUNCTIONAL** - While technical fixes have been applied to resolve specific errors, the application is **NOT yet ready for production use**. Critical UX/UI functionality from September 30, 2025 baseline has not been fully restored.

**Technical Fixes Applied** ‚úÖ:

- Dashboard calculation errors resolved
- Event handling issues fixed
- Subscription optimizations implemented

**User Experience Status** ‚ùå:

- Application does not match September 30, 2025 baseline functionality
- UX/UI workflows may still be broken or incomplete
- Full user journey testing required to identify remaining issues

### üìù **Next Session Recommendations**

1. **PRIORITY**: Compare current state to September 30, 2025 baseline
2. Conduct comprehensive UX/UI testing of all user workflows
3. Identify and document all remaining functional gaps
4. Investigate remaining triple emission source
5. Systematic restoration of missing functionality

### üéñÔ∏è **Session Success Rating**: 30%

Technical debt addressed, but application requires significant additional work to restore full September 30, 2025 functionality. **NOT production ready.**
