### 🎯 **Session Objectives Achieved**

All major user-reported issues have been resolved:

- ✅ Dashboard calculation errors fixed
- ✅ Quick Start Wizard event handling fixed
- ✅ P&L styling restored
- ✅ Expense page functionality restored
- ✅ Performance optimizations implemented

### 🔧 **Technical Fixes Applied**

#### 1. Dashboard "Invalid cost per return calculation" Error

**Problem**: State mismatch between SettingsService and WizardStateService
**Solution**: Updated MetricsAssemblerService to use wizard state consistently
**Impact**: Dashboard now displays accurate calculations without errors

**Problem**: Multiple event handlers causing triple firing and region resets
**Solution**: Removed radio button elements, implemented pure label-based selection
**Impact**: Clean single-event handling, perfect Canada → TaxRush flow

#### 3. Multiple Subscription Performance Issues

**Problem**: 19+ separate subscriptions to wizard state
**Solution**: Implemented shareReplay(1) operator across components
**Impact**: Reduced memory usage and improved performance

#### 4. Missing P&L Styling

**Problem**: Minimal CSS causing poor visual presentation
**Solution**: Restored comprehensive styling from React reference
**Impact**: Professional, complete P&L report presentation

### 🐛 **Outstanding Issue**

**Triple Emission on App Load**: Income Drivers component still logs 3 times during initial load. Investigation suggests remaining subscription leak or Angular lifecycle interaction. Functionality not impacted, only logging verbosity.
