AnalysisBlock.tsx → Angular placement and rationale

- What it is: Reusable analysis card showing status color, primary metric, optional comparison and insights.
- Where it belongs in Angular: 
  - UI: `angular/src/app/components/analysis-block/analysis-block.component.ts`
  - Types: `angular/src/app/domain/types/analysis.types.ts`
  - Future adapters (if needed): `angular/src/app/domain/adapters/analysis/*` (none yet)
- Why that location: Shared visual component used across wizard, dashboard, forecasting; types live in domain for reuse and testability.
- Inputs: `AnalysisData`, `size`, `showComparison`, `showInsights`, optional `onClick`.
- Outputs: None (presentational). Emits click via handler if provided.
- Missing: No business logic; future service may compute insights and comparison; feature-flag gating for visibility staged separately.
