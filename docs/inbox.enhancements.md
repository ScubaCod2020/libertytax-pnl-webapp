# Enhancement Inbox

Path: /docs

Purpose: Lightweight drop-zone for enhancement ideas. Keep cards short; triage later.

Template:

- Title:
- Context / Source:
- Why now:
- Acceptance (1â€“3 bullets):

Backlog (examples):

- [ ] Example: Improve validation hints on Wizard inputs (source: stakeholder Word doc)
- [ ] Example: Add a11y landmarks to WizardShell (source: internal QA)

Triage rhythm: Move accepted items to repo/app blueprint (if contract changes) and open GitHub issues with Virtual Team labels.
