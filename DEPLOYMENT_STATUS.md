# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - TROUBLESHOOTING NGINX

## ✅ Deployment Status

- **Angular Build**: ✅ Successful
- **File Copy**: ✅ Complete
- **Version**: `pnl-web-20251008-0401`
- **Files Location**: `\\192.168.1.172\Projects\apps\shipyard\pnl-web\pnl-web-20251008-0401\`
- **LATEST.txt**: ✅ Updated

## ❌ Issue: NGINX 500 Error

The deployment files are in place, but NGINX is returning 500 Internal Server Error for all requests to `/shipyard/*`. This is a **server configuration issue**, not a deployment problem.

## 🔧 Required NGINX Configuration

### Current Problem

NGINX is not properly configured to serve files from the `/shipyard` location, causing 500 errors.

### Solution

You need to configure NGINX with the settings in `nginx-shipyard.conf`. The key requirements are:

1. **Location mapping**: Map `/shipyard/` URL to your SMB mount point
2. **Index files**: Configure `index.html` as default file
3. **Angular SPA routing**: Handle client-side routing with `try_files`

### Quick Fix Commands

#### Option 1: Update NGINX Configuration

```bash
# On your Unraid/Docker host
sudo cp nginx-shipyard.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/shipyard.conf
sudo nginx -t  # Test configuration
sudo systemctl reload nginx  # or docker restart nginx
```

#### Option 2: Docker Compose Update

If using Docker, update your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/smbmount/shipyard:/mnt/shipyard:ro'
      - './nginx-shipyard.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf'
```

## 🧪 Testing After NGINX Fix

Once NGINX is configured, test the deployment:

```powershell
# Test version URL
curl -I http://192.168.1.172:8082/shipyard/pnl-web/pnl-web-20251008-0401/

# Test root redirect
curl -I http://192.168.1.172:8082/shipyard/pnl-web/

# If successful, you should see HTTP 200 OK
```

## 📋 Deployed Files

The following files are ready at:  
`\\192.168.1.172\Projects\apps\shipyard\pnl-web\pnl-web-20251008-0401\`

- ✅ `index.html` - Main Angular app
- ✅ `main-*.js` - Application JavaScript
- ✅ `polyfills-*.js` - Browser polyfills
- ✅ `styles-*.css` - Application styles
- ✅ `/assets/` - Static assets (logos, icons)
- ✅ Various `chunk-*.js` - Code split bundles

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Fix NGINX** using the provided configuration
2. **Test the URLs** to verify the fix worked
3. **Access your app** at: `http://192.168.1.172:8082/shipyard/pnl-web/`

## 🆘 Alternative: Manual Testing

If you want to verify the files work without fixing NGINX immediately:

```powershell
# Serve locally for testing
cd "\\192.168.1.172\Projects\apps\shipyard\pnl-web\pnl-web-20251008-0401"
python -m http.server 8080
# Then test: http://localhost:8080
```

The deployment scripts are working correctly - you just need to configure NGINX to serve the files properly! 🎉
